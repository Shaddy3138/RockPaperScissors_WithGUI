## Info ++
As said above, this was my first take on creating a game.
I choose this one because the logic is quite simple,  and I wanted to try out the java Fx technology.
There's a lot to be done yet, some improvements and even some minor errors. 
Consider this to be the alpha of the alpha version.


## Tech stack & Open-source libraries
- Minimum SDK Java Version 8
- JAVA FX
